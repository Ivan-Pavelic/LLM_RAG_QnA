{"id": "2384", "article": "Sport's propensity to play mind games with its protagonists was rarely more obviously stated than after qualifying for the Chinese Grand Prix, when Nico Rosberg cursed his Mercedes team. Hamilton, the world champion, was relaxed and delighted having taken pole but Rosberg, his team-mate, was grim-faced, demoralised and made his first public criticism of his team. Nico Rosberg will start behind pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton with Sebastian Vettel third on the grid in China . Rosberg cut a frustrated figure in the paddock after he missed out on pole to Hamilton by just 0.042secs . Rosberg was only four-hundredths of a second behind the Briton and will start second on the grid. Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari is third, nearly a second adrift of Hamilton. But Rosberg was visibly angry after the Mercedes pit-wall brains put him under unnecessary ‘pressure’. The German was the last driver out for his final flying lap, meaning he had to rush to get in a competitive time. Rosberg, who is customarily gracious in defeat, fell slightly short of Hamilton’s mark and was grumpy afterwards. He said: ‘It was not ideal to put me under pressure like that. I don’t think it cost me anything, but even the mind-set to know that I have to speed up a bit — we need to look into that. Sparks fly off the back of Rosberg's Mercedes during qualifying for Sunday's race in Shanghai . The German has now been out-qualified by Hamilton at each of the three races this season . ‘Other than that the lap was good  and it is very annoying as the lap is never perfect, so four hundredths is always in it. Tyre degradation is going to be a big issue for the race as we are going to take the tyres right to the limit. So there are many opportunities.’ Poor old Rosberg was cock of the walk in the early and middle parts of last season, but he seems terribly lacklustre since Hamilton won the title. Even his Mercedes boss, Niki Lauda, said he should ‘sort himself out’ — a statement on Rosberg’s psyche rather than his work ethic. Whether he has the speed to match Hamilton may be at the centre of his anger. The Briton set his fastest time on his penultimate lap. It was enough. Rosberg, though, got closer to Hamilton than he has recently. McLaren will again be towards the back of the grid with Jenson Button 17th and Fernando Alonso 18th. Barely a hair’s breadth separated the former champions. Button said: ‘I guess we hoped we might be just a bit closer than we were today. In practice, we’d looked a bit more competitive, certainly. ‘We’d found a reasonably good balance with the car, in fact, but the lap-time isn’t quite there yet.’ Hamilton will start from the front of the pack as he bids to win his fourth grand prix in China .", "highlights": "Nico Rosberg was the last driver out of the pit-lane and was forced to turn in a quicker out-lap than he would have liked ahead of his final shot at pole .\nThe German narrowly lost out  to his team-mate Lewis Hamilton .\nRosberg was just 0.042secs slower than his Mercedes rival .\nRosberg also said: 'Oh, come on, guys', over the team radio after he was informed he'd missed out on pole for Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix .", "source": "cnn_dailymail/3.0.0:test"}

Framed squad photographs of Sir Bobby alongside the likes of Alan Shearer, Gary Speed, Nobby Solano and Shay Given have been found discarded alongside grass cuttings, cardboard boxes and bin bags. The pictures were removed from corporate boxes inside the stadium and have been replaced by more recent images. Framed photographs of Sir Bobby Robson's title-chasing side were found thrown in a skip outside the stadium . The skip was situated outside St James' Park where fans were able to spot the disgraceful move by the club . Steve Wraith, of NUFC Fans United, told the Chronicle: ‘They could have auctioned them for charity, but just to put these things in the bin is awful. Now fans are talking about going and helping themselves. ‘They are pictures of club legends. I don’t think the club want people to be reminded of a time when they were doing well because they are doing so badly at the moment.’ Robson’s team finished fourth in 2002 and qualified for the Champions League, where they memorably made it to the second group phase after a last-gasp victory in Feyenoord. Alan Shearer, Gary Speed and Nolberto Solano are some of the legends who are included in the photos . Sir Bobby, who passed away in 2009, is still fondly remembered and has a statue outside of the stadium . In 2003 they topped the table for a period before finishing third, a return which has not been bettered in the years since. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the club said the images were ‘old and not being used anymore’. But the ‘AshleyOut.com’ group, who are behind Sunday’s planned boycott of Newcastle’s home match with Spurs, tweeted: ‘Our proud history in the skip outside SJP along with ambition and hope’.

Gary Speed (right), who died in 2011, was another player who loved playing for his former manager . Nolberto Solano (right) was a key figure in Newcastle's title challenge and is also seen as a club legend .

Trevor Brooks, an associate of Islamist firebrand Anjem Choudary, was told it was not in the public interest for him to have a passport because he is seen as a terror risk. A Home Office letter says that Brooks, also known as Abu Izzadeen, is an extremist linked to members of the banned group Al Muhajiroun. Trevor Brooks is a known associate of Islamist firebrand preacher Anjem Choudary (pictured) The letter adds: 'It is also assessed that you intend to travel overseas to Syria where you would use this opportunity to engage in terrorism-related activity, likely fighting alongside the terrorist organisation known as the Islamic State.' Brooks, 39, was released from prison last month after serving part of his 11-month term for breaching bail on a terrorist offence. The Home Office said it could not discuss individual cases. Chourdary made headlines last month when it emerged he had been invited to speak at the Oxford Union despite being on police bail on suspicion of being a member of a banned terror group. The notorious rabble rouser received an invitation by letter from the debating society, which stated it would be a 'great privilege' to have Choudary appear as the star guest. Choudary, who once said that Woolwich terror victim Fusilier Lee Rigby would 'burn in hellfire', was even offered a choice of days on which to attend the debate entitled: This house believes that radicalism is born at home. Britain's most notorious hate preacher proudly showed off his invitation after launching a hate-filled rant against Western society outside the Houses of Parliament in late March. He said: 'I am still on police bail after being arrested by Scotland Yard in September last year. 'But the police can't stop me from speaking. They can't stop me from going to the Oxford Union where I've been invited to speak.' He was one of nine men held in a series of co-ordinated dawn raids by counter terrorism police in September last year.

Dyche, 43, has won admirers for his plain speaking and organising a competitive team on a restricted budget. Derby, however, believe he will be tempted by a move to a bigger club — their average home gate of 29,000 is 10,000 more than Burnley get at Turf Moor.

If you have the bank balance of a mogul you could splash out on the house used for location shoots in the Fox show, which is filmed in the Chicago area. The enormous 20,000 square foot mansion in the ritzy suburb of Barrington is opulent and private, sitting by two lakes in eight acres of manicured gardens. Scroll Down for Video . Fit for a mogul - the enormous mansion serves as the backdrop to the hit show Empire . It took five years to build the house, which sits by two lakes in eight acres of manicured gardens . The sophisticated five bedroom, nine bathroom French Country-style estate that serves as a glamorous backdrop to the show is listed at $13 million, having failed to find a buyer at $15.9 million since it first hit the market in 2013. It took five years to build the enormous mansion, with construction finally coming to a halt in 2008. This lengthy building period was partly due to the huge amount of custom woodwork and ornamentation in the house. The show centers on Lucious Lyon, played by Terence Howard, deciding which of his three sons will take over his company, Empire Entertainment . For the show, the interiors are staged often to look more dramatic than the house does in real life . The mansion even has an owner worthy of Empire, in strip club owner Sam Cecola, according to Curbed. Cecola owns the Admiral Theater strip club in Albany Park, Illinois, and previously owned the Club Paradise strip club in Las Vegas. He had to relinquish ownership of the Las Vegas property due to legal problems involving tax fraud and alleged connections to organized crime. As in the show, the stately living room features a grand piano . The house is as opulent in real life as it is in the show and has a lot of room for entertaining . The house includes a wet bar, walnut-paneled library, huge gourmet kitchen and a built-in safe and state-of-the-art security system. Outside there is a dog run, an outdoor pool, outdoor fireplace and a pond, as well as extensive waterfront views. A full bar opens out onto a terrace and the garden on the lower level . A light bright dining room just off the grand hallway . In the show, Luscious Lyon, played by Terence Howard, has been diagnosed with ALS and is trying to determine which of his three sons will succeed him and run his entertainment business. His outspoken ex-wife, Cookie, played by Taraji P. Henson, is fresh out of prison after 17 years for drug dealing and is also demanding her share of the business. The bedrooms are simply and elegantly decorated in a tasteful color palette . In the show, Lucious' daughter Lola has a bedroom fit for a princess .

Carrie Reichert (left), 43, has released a teaser from her upcoming book In the Eye of the Royal Story in which she recounts the events of Prince Harry's infamous party night .

She wrote: 'I'm only in my bathing suit and feeling overdressed, wondering if I too should strip down and join him in his royal buff.' Ms Reichert went on to claim that alcohol gave her the confidence to approach the Prince before they shared a kiss. She said: 'This surreal moment felt more like a dream: I'm kissing a Prince! Tasting his lips and feeling his tongue, encouraging what is now a hot, deep kiss, both of us excited, anticipating what is yet to come.'

At Dolgellau Magistrates Court, Garrod had claimed he was rushing to work after a colleague had contacted him before he set off and told him that a cyclist was injured on the A470 at Dolgellau in north Wales. But the judge ordered an adjournment to take various witness statements before making a decision on his driving ban. That's when bosses began their own investigations and discovered the extent of Garrod's lies and opened a special misconduct hearing. Yesterday, the disciplinary hearing was told Garrod filled in a 'patient clinical record' for the bogus call to back up his false story. Garrod - a paramedic for ten years - was caught out when ambulance chiefs checked to find no record of the 999 call on the day of his speeding ticket. The panel heard the ambulance trust had no records of any 999 alert on the A470 at Dolgellau, North Wales, on 25 April 2011 - the day he was caught speeding. A report from the Health and Care Professionals Council said: 'The conduct was deliberate and was designed to mitigate the fact that he had been caught speeding. 'His actions were pre-meditated as he went as far as falsifying documentation to support his story. 'This would be deemed to be dishonest by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people.' Garrod claimed he was rushing to work after a colleague had contacted him before he set off and told him that a cyclist was injured on the A470 at Dolgellau but was caught out when bosses checked 999 records . Father-of-two Garrod did not attend the disciplinary hearing in Cardiff but said in writing he had 'confused the dates'. Garrod denied five allegations relating to providing false statements, creating a false patient clinic record and dishonesty. But he was struck off after being found guilty of misconduct. The disciplinary hearing ruled: 'Such conduct by a health professional falls well below the standards expected of a registered health professional and consequently amounts to misconduct.'", "highlights": "Philip Garrod caught while on way to work with Welsh Ambulance Service .\nPleaded guilty to offence but asked for special consideration to avoid ban .\nClaimed he was rushing to see injured cyclist after message from colleague .\nFalsified patient document for fake cyclist injury on the A470 at Dolgellau .\nRumbled after bosses checked 999 calls and found none matching the claim .", "source": "cnn_dailymail/3.0.0:test"}

Those who frequently dine out or feast on takeaways are more likely to have pre-hypertension – elevated blood pressure – with just one extra meal out a week raising the odds by six per cent, a study found. Eating out is associated with higher calorie, saturated fat and salt intake – all causes of high blood pressure. Scroll down for video . A study found that just one extra meal out a week raising the odds of having high blood pressure by six per cent. Stock photo . A team at Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School in Singapore found 27.4 per cent of the population suffered from pre-hypertension. Of these, 38 per cent ate more than 12 meals out per week, the American Journal of Hypertension reported. Professor Tazeen Jafar, of Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School Singapore (Duke-NUS), designed and supervised a study to find behaviour associated with hypertension in a young adult population in South East Asia. Her team surveyed 501 university students, aged 18 to 40, in Singapore. Figures on blood pressure, body mass index (BMI) and lifestyle, including meals eaten away from home and physical activity levels, were collected. The association with hypertension was then determined. Researchers in Singapore found those who frequently dine out or feast on takeaways are more likely to have pre-hypertension. Stock photo . Using statistical analysis, the researchers found that pre-hypertension was found in 27.4 per cent of the total population, and 38 per cent ate more than 12 meals away from home per week; while the gender breakdown showed that pre-hypertension was much more prevalent in men (49 per cent) than in women (nine per cent). The findings showed those who had pre-hypertension or hypertension were more likely to eat more meals away from home per week, have a higher mean BMI, have lower mean physical activity levels, and be current smokers. The novel finding of the study, published online by the American Journal of Hypertension, was the link that Dr. Jafar's team was able to show between pre-hypertension and hypertension with meals eaten away from home. The researchers said that what was also significant was that even eating one extra meal out, raised the odds of pre-hypertension by six per cent. Dr Jafar said: 'While there have been studies conducted in the United States and Japan to find behaviours associated with hypertension, very few have surveyed a South East Asian population. 'Our research plugs that gap and highlights lifestyle factors associated with pre-hypertension and hypertension that are potentially modifiable, and would be applicable to young adults globally, especially those of Asian descent.' She said future studies should examine the effect of lifestyle modification programmes on blood pressure levels of at-risk people.", "highlights": "Those who often dine out are more likely to have elevated blood pressure .\nEating out is associated with higher calorie, saturated fat and salt intake .\nResearchers found 27.4% of Singapore's population had pre-hypertension .\nOf these, more than a third ate more than 12 meals out every week .", "source": "cnn_dailymail/3.0.0:test"}

Christopher Furniss-Roe from Pontypool, South Wales, was found in his bedroom by his father just 15 minutes after the 'childish' argument with his younger sister. His father Jason desperately tried to save his son's life but he died the next day in hospital. A coroner ruled it was a tragic accident - saying the eight-year-old was probably looking for 'sympathy and forgiveness' after the row. The hearing was told Christopher was happy after being placed in a series of races at his school's sports day. But after coming home from school that afternoon, Christopher has a  'childish' row with his sister which culminated in her bucket being broken and her suffering a cut lip. Their father told his son to go to bed as a minor punishment, but after 15 minutes he found him hanging in his room. Mr Furniss-Roe cut his son down and performed first aid. But Christopher was taken to hospital and had his life support machine switched off the following day. Gwent coroner David Bowen said: 'Christopher had been naughty and as a result he had been sent to his room. 'It was far more probable that he was pretending to hang himself to get sympathy and forgiveness. 'But it all went tragically wrong. 'A heart-wrenching decision was made to turn that [life support] machine off the following day.' Dr Stephen Leadbeatter, a consultant pathologist at the University of Wales Hospital in Cardiff, concluded that the youngster had died as a result of hanging after a post-mortem.

Honorary Research Associate at Launceston's Queen Victoria Museum Simon Fearn told ABC it took two days to unearth the nest from the ground and four men to carry it out of the bush. 'A one-year-old nest is the size of a soccer ball, but this nest takes up the best part of a cubic metre,' he said. 'Normally European wasp nests don't survive through winter, but last year's mild, dry winter allowed it to survive into its second year.'
