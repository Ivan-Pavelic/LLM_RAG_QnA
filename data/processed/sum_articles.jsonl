{"id": "2384", "article": "Sport's propensity to play mind games with its protagonists was rarely more obviously stated than after qualifying for the Chinese Grand Prix, when Nico Rosberg cursed his Mercedes team. Hamilton, the world champion, was relaxed and delighted having taken pole but Rosberg, his team-mate, was grim-faced, demoralised and made his first public criticism of his team. Nico Rosberg will start behind pole-sitter Lewis Hamilton with Sebastian Vettel third on the grid in China . Rosberg cut a frustrated figure in the paddock after he missed out on pole to Hamilton by just 0.042secs . Rosberg was only four-hundredths of a second behind the Briton and will start second on the grid. Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari is third, nearly a second adrift of Hamilton. But Rosberg was visibly angry after the Mercedes pit-wall brains put him under unnecessary ‘pressure’. The German was the last driver out for his final flying lap, meaning he had to rush to get in a competitive time. Rosberg, who is customarily gracious in defeat, fell slightly short of Hamilton’s mark and was grumpy afterwards. He said: ‘It was not ideal to put me under pressure like that. I don’t think it cost me anything, but even the mind-set to know that I have to speed up a bit — we need to look into that. Sparks fly off the back of Rosberg's Mercedes during qualifying for Sunday's race in Shanghai . The German has now been out-qualified by Hamilton at each of the three races this season . ‘Other than that the lap was good  and it is very annoying as the lap is never perfect, so four hundredths is always in it. Tyre degradation is going to be a big issue for the race as we are going to take the tyres right to the limit. So there are many opportunities.’ Poor old Rosberg was cock of the walk in the early and middle parts of last season, but he seems terribly lacklustre since Hamilton won the title. Even his Mercedes boss, Niki Lauda, said he should ‘sort himself out’ — a statement on Rosberg’s psyche rather than his work ethic. Whether he has the speed to match Hamilton may be at the centre of his anger. The Briton set his fastest time on his penultimate lap. It was enough. Rosberg, though, got closer to Hamilton than he has recently. McLaren will again be towards the back of the grid with Jenson Button 17th and Fernando Alonso 18th. Barely a hair’s breadth separated the former champions. Button said: ‘I guess we hoped we might be just a bit closer than we were today. In practice, we’d looked a bit more competitive, certainly. ‘We’d found a reasonably good balance with the car, in fact, but the lap-time isn’t quite there yet.’ Hamilton will start from the front of the pack as he bids to win his fourth grand prix in China .", "highlights": "Nico Rosberg was the last driver out of the pit-lane and was forced to turn in a quicker out-lap than he would have liked ahead of his final shot at pole .\nThe German narrowly lost out  to his team-mate Lewis Hamilton .\nRosberg was just 0.042secs slower than his Mercedes rival .\nRosberg also said: 'Oh, come on, guys', over the team radio after he was informed he'd missed out on pole for Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix .", "source": "cnn_dailymail/3.0.0:test"}

Framed squad photographs of Sir Bobby alongside the likes of Alan Shearer, Gary Speed, Nobby Solano and Shay Given have been found discarded alongside grass cuttings, cardboard boxes and bin bags. The pictures were removed from corporate boxes inside the stadium and have been replaced by more recent images. Framed photographs of Sir Bobby Robson's title-chasing side were found thrown in a skip outside the stadium . The skip was situated outside St James' Park where fans were able to spot the disgraceful move by the club . Steve Wraith, of NUFC Fans United, told the Chronicle: ‘They could have auctioned them for charity, but just to put these things in the bin is awful. Now fans are talking about going and helping themselves. ‘They are pictures of club legends. I don’t think the club want people to be reminded of a time when they were doing well because they are doing so badly at the moment.’ Robson’s team finished fourth in 2002 and qualified for the Champions League, where they memorably made it to the second group phase after a last-gasp victory in Feyenoord. Alan Shearer, Gary Speed and Nolberto Solano are some of the legends who are included in the photos . Sir Bobby, who passed away in 2009, is still fondly remembered and has a statue outside of the stadium . In 2003 they topped the table for a period before finishing third, a return which has not been bettered in the years since. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the club said the images were ‘old and not being used anymore’. But the ‘AshleyOut.com’ group, who are behind Sunday’s planned boycott of Newcastle’s home match with Spurs, tweeted: ‘Our proud history in the skip outside SJP along with ambition and hope’.

Gary Speed (right), who died in 2011, was another player who loved playing for his former manager . Nolberto Solano (right) was a key figure in Newcastle's title challenge and is also seen as a club legend .

Trevor Brooks, an associate of Islamist firebrand Anjem Choudary, was told it was not in the public interest for him to have a passport because he is seen as a terror risk. A Home Office letter says that Brooks, also known as Abu Izzadeen, is an extremist linked to members of the banned group Al Muhajiroun. Trevor Brooks is a known associate of Islamist firebrand preacher Anjem Choudary (pictured) The letter adds: 'It is also assessed that you intend to travel overseas to Syria where you would use this opportunity to engage in terrorism-related activity, likely fighting alongside the terrorist organisation known as the Islamic State.' Brooks, 39, was released from prison last month after serving part of his 11-month term for breaching bail on a terrorist offence. The Home Office said it could not discuss individual cases. Chourdary made headlines last month when it emerged he had been invited to speak at the Oxford Union despite being on police bail on suspicion of being a member of a banned terror group. The notorious rabble rouser received an invitation by letter from the debating society, which stated it would be a 'great privilege' to have Choudary appear as the star guest. Choudary, who once said that Woolwich terror victim Fusilier Lee Rigby would 'burn in hellfire', was even offered a choice of days on which to attend the debate entitled: This house believes that radicalism is born at home. Britain's most notorious hate preacher proudly showed off his invitation after launching a hate-filled rant against Western society outside the Houses of Parliament in late March. He said: 'I am still on police bail after being arrested by Scotland Yard in September last year. 'But the police can't stop me from speaking. They can't stop me from going to the Oxford Union where I've been invited to speak.' He was one of nine men held in a series of co-ordinated dawn raids by counter terrorism police in September last year.

Dyche, 43, has won admirers for his plain speaking and organising a competitive team on a restricted budget. Derby, however, believe he will be tempted by a move to a bigger club — their average home gate of 29,000 is 10,000 more than Burnley get at Turf Moor.

If you have the bank balance of a mogul you could splash out on the house used for location shoots in the Fox show, which is filmed in the Chicago area. The enormous 20,000 square foot mansion in the ritzy suburb of Barrington is opulent and private, sitting by two lakes in eight acres of manicured gardens. Scroll Down for Video . Fit for a mogul - the enormous mansion serves as the backdrop to the hit show Empire . It took five years to build the house, which sits by two lakes in eight acres of manicured gardens . The sophisticated five bedroom, nine bathroom French Country-style estate that serves as a glamorous backdrop to the show is listed at $13 million, having failed to find a buyer at $15.9 million since it first hit the market in 2013. It took five years to build the enormous mansion, with construction finally coming to a halt in 2008. This lengthy building period was partly due to the huge amount of custom woodwork and ornamentation in the house. The show centers on Lucious Lyon, played by Terence Howard, deciding which of his three sons will take over his company, Empire Entertainment . For the show, the interiors are staged often to look more dramatic than the house does in real life . The mansion even has an owner worthy of Empire, in strip club owner Sam Cecola, according to Curbed. Cecola owns the Admiral Theater strip club in Albany Park, Illinois, and previously owned the Club Paradise strip club in Las Vegas. He had to relinquish ownership of the Las Vegas property due to legal problems involving tax fraud and alleged connections to organized crime. As in the show, the stately living room features a grand piano . The house is as opulent in real life as it is in the show and has a lot of room for entertaining . The house includes a wet bar, walnut-paneled library, huge gourmet kitchen and a built-in safe and state-of-the-art security system. Outside there is a dog run, an outdoor pool, outdoor fireplace and a pond, as well as extensive waterfront views. A full bar opens out onto a terrace and the garden on the lower level . A light bright dining room just off the grand hallway . In the show, Luscious Lyon, played by Terence Howard, has been diagnosed with ALS and is trying to determine which of his three sons will succeed him and run his entertainment business. His outspoken ex-wife, Cookie, played by Taraji P. Henson, is fresh out of prison after 17 years for drug dealing and is also demanding her share of the business. The bedrooms are simply and elegantly decorated in a tasteful color palette . In the show, Lucious' daughter Lola has a bedroom fit for a princess .

Carrie Reichert (left), 43, has released a teaser from her upcoming book In the Eye of the Royal Story in which she recounts the events of Prince Harry's infamous party night .

She wrote: 'I'm only in my bathing suit and feeling overdressed, wondering if I too should strip down and join him in his royal buff.' Ms Reichert went on to claim that alcohol gave her the confidence to approach the Prince before they shared a kiss. She said: 'This surreal moment felt more like a dream: I'm kissing a Prince! Tasting his lips and feeling his tongue, encouraging what is now a hot, deep kiss, both of us excited, anticipating what is yet to come.'

At Dolgellau Magistrates Court, Garrod had claimed he was rushing to work after a colleague had contacted him before he set off and told him that a cyclist was injured on the A470 at Dolgellau in north Wales. But the judge ordered an adjournment to take various witness statements before making a decision on his driving ban. That's when bosses began their own investigations and discovered the extent of Garrod's lies and opened a special misconduct hearing. Yesterday, the disciplinary hearing was told Garrod filled in a 'patient clinical record' for the bogus call to back up his false story. Garrod - a paramedic for ten years - was caught out when ambulance chiefs checked to find no record of the 999 call on the day of his speeding ticket. The panel heard the ambulance trust had no records of any 999 alert on the A470 at Dolgellau, North Wales, on 25 April 2011 - the day he was caught speeding. A report from the Health and Care Professionals Council said: 'The conduct was deliberate and was designed to mitigate the fact that he had been caught speeding. 'His actions were pre-meditated as he went as far as falsifying documentation to support his story. 'This would be deemed to be dishonest by the ordinary standards of reasonable and honest people.' Garrod claimed he was rushing to work after a colleague had contacted him before he set off and told him that a cyclist was injured on the A470 at Dolgellau but was caught out when bosses checked 999 records . Father-of-two Garrod did not attend the disciplinary hearing in Cardiff but said in writing he had 'confused the dates'. Garrod denied five allegations relating to providing false statements, creating a false patient clinic record and dishonesty. But he was struck off after being found guilty of misconduct. The disciplinary hearing ruled: 'Such conduct by a health professional falls well below the standards expected of a registered health professional and consequently amounts to misconduct.'", "highlights": "Philip Garrod caught while on way to work with Welsh Ambulance Service .\nPleaded guilty to offence but asked for special consideration to avoid ban .\nClaimed he was rushing to see injured cyclist after message from colleague .\nFalsified patient document for fake cyclist injury on the A470 at Dolgellau .\nRumbled after bosses checked 999 calls and found none matching the claim .", "source": "cnn_dailymail/3.0.0:test"}

Those who frequently dine out or feast on takeaways are more likely to have pre-hypertension – elevated blood pressure – with just one extra meal out a week raising the odds by six per cent, a study found. Eating out is associated with higher calorie, saturated fat and salt intake – all causes of high blood pressure. Scroll down for video . A study found that just one extra meal out a week raising the odds of having high blood pressure by six per cent. Stock photo . A team at Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School in Singapore found 27.4 per cent of the population suffered from pre-hypertension. Of these, 38 per cent ate more than 12 meals out per week, the American Journal of Hypertension reported. Professor Tazeen Jafar, of Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School Singapore (Duke-NUS), designed and supervised a study to find behaviour associated with hypertension in a young adult population in South East Asia. Her team surveyed 501 university students, aged 18 to 40, in Singapore. Figures on blood pressure, body mass index (BMI) and lifestyle, including meals eaten away from home and physical activity levels, were collected. The association with hypertension was then determined. Researchers in Singapore found those who frequently dine out or feast on takeaways are more likely to have pre-hypertension. Stock photo . Using statistical analysis, the researchers found that pre-hypertension was found in 27.4 per cent of the total population, and 38 per cent ate more than 12 meals away from home per week; while the gender breakdown showed that pre-hypertension was much more prevalent in men (49 per cent) than in women (nine per cent). The findings showed those who had pre-hypertension or hypertension were more likely to eat more meals away from home per week, have a higher mean BMI, have lower mean physical activity levels, and be current smokers. The novel finding of the study, published online by the American Journal of Hypertension, was the link that Dr. Jafar's team was able to show between pre-hypertension and hypertension with meals eaten away from home. The researchers said that what was also significant was that even eating one extra meal out, raised the odds of pre-hypertension by six per cent. Dr Jafar said: 'While there have been studies conducted in the United States and Japan to find behaviours associated with hypertension, very few have surveyed a South East Asian population. 'Our research plugs that gap and highlights lifestyle factors associated with pre-hypertension and hypertension that are potentially modifiable, and would be applicable to young adults globally, especially those of Asian descent.' She said future studies should examine the effect of lifestyle modification programmes on blood pressure levels of at-risk people.", "highlights": "Those who often dine out are more likely to have elevated blood pressure .\nEating out is associated with higher calorie, saturated fat and salt intake .\nResearchers found 27.4% of Singapore's population had pre-hypertension .\nOf these, more than a third ate more than 12 meals out every week .", "source": "cnn_dailymail/3.0.0:test"}

Christopher Furniss-Roe from Pontypool, South Wales, was found in his bedroom by his father just 15 minutes after the 'childish' argument with his younger sister. His father Jason desperately tried to save his son's life but he died the next day in hospital. A coroner ruled it was a tragic accident - saying the eight-year-old was probably looking for 'sympathy and forgiveness' after the row. The hearing was told Christopher was happy after being placed in a series of races at his school's sports day. But after coming home from school that afternoon, Christopher has a  'childish' row with his sister which culminated in her bucket being broken and her suffering a cut lip. Their father told his son to go to bed as a minor punishment, but after 15 minutes he found him hanging in his room. Mr Furniss-Roe cut his son down and performed first aid. But Christopher was taken to hospital and had his life support machine switched off the following day. Gwent coroner David Bowen said: 'Christopher had been naughty and as a result he had been sent to his room.

{"id": "11361", "article": "Teenage girls do better in single sex schools as they can focus on their work rather than impressing boys, a leading headmistress says. Rhiannon Wilkinson, head of Wycombe Abbey in Buckinghamshire reportedly said that a 'boy free' environment stops girls from being held back by the opposite sex, who are known to mature slower. She also suggested that single-sex boarding schools give pupils relief and protection from the 'highly sexualised world' and allow them to 'remain girls for longer.' 'My wide educational experience in both mixed and girls' schools has shown me clearly that girls are best served educationally in their teenage years in a boy-free work environment,' she said according to the Telegraph. Rhiannon Wilkinson, the head of Wycombe Abbey in Buckinghamshire, pictured, claims a 'boy free' environment allows teenage girls to focus on their work . She added: 'In co-ed environments lots of girls when adolescence kicks want to be liked by boys not just for their intelligence and want to be popular with boys. But she said in all girl environments pupils are 'free from that,' according to the Telegraph. Two years ago Scientists at Newcastle University found that girls really do mature faster than boys. They discovered that as the brain matures it begins to 'prune' information that is stored and focus on what is important. Tony Little, head at Eton College, has previously said that single sex schools allow children to retain their 'innocence' For girls this can happen as early as 10 years old, but for boys it can take until between 15 and 20 for the same. Tony Little, the head of Eton College, has also spoken of the benefits of single sex schools. He said they allow children to retain their 'innocence' and be 'themselves' for longer. 'What does strike me is that in a single-sex environment, particularly at the age of 13, 14, 15, there is an opportunity for both boys and girls to be themselves for longer. To be 'boyish' for longer, to be young girls,' he said, according to the BBC. Boys could also benefit from being taught separately. Statistics have shown that boys often lag behind girls at both GCSE and A-level and are much less likely to apply to university. Alun Jones, the first male president of the Girls' Schools Association, has previously called for teenage boys  to be taught in single sex classes in state schools. Mr Jones, who is also a schools inspector, said: 'If you have a very bright, very driven, very focused, very articulate lady, which a lot of girls are, that intimidates a boy in the classroom, especially boys of average ability. 'The result is that boys don't put their hands up to answer questions or they indulge in immature behaviour to avoid being shown up. Boys are falling behind as girls are doing better.'", "highlights": "'Boy free' environment stops girls from being held back by opposite sex .\nGirls in single sex education don't have to worry about impressing boys .\nComments made by head of Wycombe Abbey School in Buckinghamshire .\nCome after calls for boys to be taught separately in state schools .", "source": "cnn_dailymail/3.0.0:test"}

Keaton acknowledged in his opening monologue that a lot has changed since he first hosted the comedy sketch show in 1982. \"I had a baby -- he's 31. I also have a new girlfriend -- she's 28,\" he said. Fans who were hoping for a full-blown revival of Keaton's most memorable characters might have been a little disappointed. SNL cast members Taran Killam and Bobby Moynihan begged the actor with a song to \"play\" Batman and Beetlejuice with them. All they got in response were a couple of one-liners. Overall, Keaton's performance drew high marks from viewers and critics for its \"deadpan\" manner and \"unpredictable weirdness,\" in the words of A.V. Club's Dennis Perkins. Fans also delighted in a cameo from \"Walking Dead\" star Norman Reedus during Weekend Update. Keaton scored some laughs from the audience as an ad executive who's not very good at his job, a confused grandfather and a high school teacher who gets asked to the prom in a riff on the romantic comedy \"She's All That.\" Other crowd-pleasing spots included a Scientology parody music video and a news conference spoofing the NCAA student-athlete debate. The show also poked fun at CNN with cast member Cecily Strong playing anchor Brooke Baldwin.

{"id": "10012", "article": "Mila Kunis is being sued by a Ukrainian wannabe singer who claims the Hollywood actress 'stole her pet chicken' as children. Kristina Karo alleges that she was a classmate of Ms Kunis, 31, who moved to the U.S. from Ukraine in 1991,  and that the pair were 'inseparable'  growing up. Karo, now living in Los Angeles, claims a seven-year-old Ms Kunis had been 'envious' of her pet hen, and that 25 years ago, she stole it from her. Bizzare lawsuit: Wannabe singer Kristina Karo  claims the theft of her pet chicken as a child in Ukraine traumatised her, and is now suing 'thief' Mila Kunis for $5,000 . In her lawsuit, Karo states that Ms Kunis would come over to the chicken farm in north-west Ukraine where she lived, and play with the hen, called 'Doggie', TMZ reports. She alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Ms Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm', the website states. Karo, who has moved to Los Angeles in the hopes of launching a career as a singer, says the theft of her pet chicken  traumatised her and forced her to see a therapist. She claims that being in close proximity to Ms Kunis, who lives in Hollywood with partner Ashton Kutcher and daughter Wyatt, has 'brought back all the bad memories' and she now needs therapy again. Bad memories: The reason for the lawsuit 25 years after the 'theft' is that moving to LA, which is where Kunis also lives, has brought back memories of losing 'Doggie' for Karo and forced her back into therapy . Not a bad egg: Mila Kunis, seen here with partner Ashton Kutcher in Los Angeles, is being accused of chicken theft despite growing up more than 100miles from Karo . In her suit, Karo alleges that when 'Doggie' disappeared, Kunis confessed to the crime and told her 'Kristina, you can have any other chicken as a pet, you have a whole chicken farm' (stock image) Karo, whose song Give Me Green Card has more than 70,000 views on YouTube, is suing the actress Kunis for $5,000 for emotional distress and to cover her therapy bills. She also claims the theft of 'Doggie' 25 years ago has 'prevented her from pursuing the American dream', according to TMZ. Interestingly enough, Karo's self-penned online bio describes her as being 'born and raised in the small village Berezhnytsia', which is a three hour drive - and more than 100miles away -from Chernivtsi, where Mila Kunis lived before moving to the U.S. aged seven. Wannabe: 'Singer' Kristina Karo says she and Kunis were inseparable in first grade, but that the actress was jealous of her pet chicken 'Doggie' and stole the hen .", "highlights": "Mila Kunis' 'childhood friend from Ukraine' is suing her for $5,000 .\nKristina Karo claims Kunis 'stole her pet chicken' as children .\nKaro, now in LA, claims she has been traumatised by the event .\nShe is suing actress for emotional distress and therapy bills .", "source": "cnn_dailymail/3.0.0:test"}

The ruler of Dubai is set to build a personal six-storey super car park in London for his fleet of more than 100 luxury motors. The ultimate toy cupboard will house up to 114 cars and have five-star accommodation for chauffeurs and staff. It is being built by the billionaire emir of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, one of the world’s richest men. The car park will be built next to Battersea heliport by the River Thames, allowing him and his associates – including his 23 children – to arrive in the capital by helicopter and jump straight into whichever luxury car they like. But neighbours are worried their road will be spoilt by the estimated 120 cars arriving and departing each day. The Sheikh, who is also vice president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, has business interests including the Godolphin horseracing stables and the Jumeirah luxury hotel group. His super car park will have two basement floors and six above ground, to include offices, bathrooms and three triple-bedroom flats for the drivers. Though the site is already used for storing cars, angry neighbours are opposed to the car park being built, with one writing: ‘Mendip Road has become the personal fiefdom of the drivers who work from the current car storage facility.’ Another, Jane Helm, 52, said: ‘This sounds like another example of an enormously wealthy foreigner making big plans without thinking much about local people who just want to live in peace. Plans: The car park would have two basement floors and six storeys above ground if planning permission is granted . Massive fleet: The Sheik has 114 cars that he hopes to park in six-storey building by the Thames . 'The last thing we want is a Sheikh and his kids roaring in and out of a great big car park everyday. ‘If it’s as bad as we think it’s going to be, the whole area will be spoilt.’ Plans for the land were submitted by Smech Management Company, which is also behind the Sheikh’s proposed 16-bedroom mansion in the Scottish Highlands. Planning proposal: Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, one of the world’s richest men, is looking to build a six-storey car park to house his fleet . The planning application was approved by councillors at Wandsworth Borough Council. No figure was given for the cost, but construction sources estimated it would cost about £4million to build up, three times as much to excavate the basements, and another ‘couple of million’ for any finishing touches, making an estimated total of nearly £20million. However the source said: ‘That’s just the basic structure. Obviously it will be a lot more if he’s planning to cover it in marble.’", "highlights": "Car park will be next to Battersea heliport so Sheik can fly in .\nWill feature two basement floors and six levels above ground .\nNeighbours worried about volume of traffic it will bring to area .\nThey say his enormous wealth should not be put before local needs .", "source": "cnn_dailymail/3.0.0:test"}

Hinckley, who still spends half of his days institutionalized after being found not guilty by reason of insanity for shooting President Ronald Reagan back in 1981, is said to have met the woman at a National Association for the Mentally Ill meeting. This was revealed by his brother Scott during a hearing to determine if Hinckley should be able to permanently live outside St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington and instead with his mother, where he has resided 17 days out of the month since December 2013. Scroll down for video . John Hinckley Jr. (above) has been dating a woman he met at a National Association for the Mentally Ill meeting . This was revealed by his brother Scott (above) during a hearing to determine if he should be released from the institution he has been at since shooting President Reagan . Hinckley currently splits his time between St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington and his mother's home in Williamsburg, Virginia (above) Scott went on to describe his brother and his new girlfriend as 'somewhat compatible,' though he admitted he had not met the woman. Hinckley's mother Joan has been introduced to her son's girlfriend reports NBC News. Hinckley shot Reagan and three others, including White House press secretary James Brady, in a bid to impress actress Jodie Foster, with whom he was obsessed. Testimony is expected to wrap up next week to determine if he can move in permanently with his mother, but it could be months before US District Judge Paul Friedman renders a decision. Prosecutor Colleen Kennedy has argued that the provisions suggested for expanded release were inadequate for a would-be presidential assassin. Hinckley also has written to killers Ted Bundy and Charles Manson, and in January he deceived doctors about where he was going when he was away from St. Elizabeths, she said. 'Now is not the time to loosen the reins of the hospital,' she said. Hinckley's mother Joan (above) has been introduced to her son's girlfriend . Hinckley (left) shot Reagan and three others, including White House press secretary James Brady, in a bid to impress actress Jodie Foster in 1981 (right) Initial testimony centered on whether Hinckley's family could bear the financial cost of supporting him and his care. Prosecutors put the cost at $5,000 to $10,000 a month, and said the family would run out of money in one or two years. But his siblings, who both live in Dallas, said the value of their mother's retirement fund and home totaled about $500,000, and vowed to support him financially. During a 2011 hearing, prosecutors argued Hinckley repeatedly engaged in deception when away from the hospital. Secret Service agents saw him browsing books on Reagan and on other presidential assassins in 2011 instead of going to a movie, as he had told doctors he would. Brady died in August at age 73, and a coroner determined the death was attributable to the shooting. Prosecutors declined to press charges.", "highlights": "John Hinckley Jr. has been dating a woman he met at a National Association for the Mentally Ill meeting .\nThis was revealed during a hearing to determine if he should be released from the institution he has been at since shooting President Reagan .\nHinckley currently splits his time between St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington and his mother's home in Williamsburg, Virginia .", "source": "cnn_dailymail/3.0.0:test"}

LeBron James has been able to do just about anything he wants during his team's first three playoff games this season and that has apparently carried over to practice as well. James was at practice with his Cleveland Cavalier teammates on Saturday at the TD Garden in Boston before their game against the Celtics on Sunday afternoon. During a break in the action, James decided to practice his long-range shooting. Scroll down for video . LeBron James hit a one-handed shot, which traveled almost the full length of the 94-foot court, on Saturday . After he wound up for the shot (left), James flicked it overhand (right) while his teammates watched him shoot . Just before the long distance shot went through the hoop, James could be heard saying: 'Give me my money' The NBA superstar grabbed a basketball and flicked it with relative ease at the hoop at the other end of the court. The one-handed shot, which traveled almost the entire length of the 94-foot court, dropped through the basket with an audible swish. Just before the full-court shot hit nothing but net, 'King James' said: 'Give me my money'. It's unclear who, if anyone James bet with, but James Jones did seem as if he was trying to disrupt the former MVP's concentration before the shot. Jones was also teammates with James when they both played for the Miami Heat. In 13 career postseason games in Boston, James is averaging about 29 points, nine rebounds, and six assists . After the video began to spread via social media, Dwight Howard of the Houston Rockets issued a response. In a clip the team posted, the center is seen swishing a one-handed shot of his own while wearing a yellow backpack. Instead of tossing the ball overhand, Howard used a motion that was one part underhand and one part sidearm to make his full-court shot find paydirt.

Following the first three races of the new Formula One season it is clear Mercedes will not have it all their own way as Ferrari appear poised to push them all the way. Wolff's remark also comes in the wake of Nico Rosberg's moaning over the team radio during Sunday's Chinese Grand Prix about how slow team-mate Lewis Hamilton was driving. Toto Wolff (left) says Nico Rosberg (right) and Lewis Hamilton will have to deal with some 'unpopular calls' Rosberg then turned on Hamilton during the post-race press conference, accusing the world champion of being selfish. Hamilton insisted he was merely looking after his tyres to ensure they lasted during the crucial middle stint of the race, with the 30-year-old exonerated of any wrongdoing by Wolff and Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda. But Wolff has confirmed that with pressure from Ferrari, rather than his drivers simply allowed to fight it out between themselves as was the case last season, there may be decisions taken on the pit wall during a race that could anger one or the other. The British driver won the Chinese grand prix but has come under fire from his Mercedes team-mate . 'It may be if we are risking a win against Ferrari we would make an unpopular call, not to freeze everything, but manage them more,' Wolff said. 'Our number one objective, which is what we have decided with the drivers, is we have a big responsibility to the team and the brand. 'It's not just about those two guys - it's about the thousand people working on those cars.

'We don't have the gap that we did last year where we can just let them push each other until the very end. We need to manage the gaps.' Suggested to Wolff he was risking Mercedes' DNA as racers - something he has insisted all along would never be tampered with - he replied: 'It depends on what you do. 'We have seen in the past a clear team order that has stated 'you are not allowed to overtake' even though the driver behind may be faster, for example.

Robert Charles Bates shot and killed Eric Courtney Harris as the younger man was trying to buy drugs and a gun from deputies posing as dealers in the parking lot of a dollar store. Harris, 44, was being restrained by one of the undercover police officers when Bates, who was monitoring from afar, ran up 'trying to get the situation under control' and fired one shot. According to police at the scene in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Bates, a former full-time officer, accidentally pulled out his service weapon instead of the stun gun. Confusion: Robert Charles Bates, 73, accidentally grabbed his pistol and shot a man dead, it has been claimed . Major Shannon Clark told CNN: 'They were struggling trying to get him into custody, he ran up trying to use a less lethal device, trying to get the situation under control, inadvertently he discharged a round from his service weapon.' He added: 'Did an accident happen? Sure. But is it accredited to his age? Or was it accredited to the rapidly evolving situation? I guess that will be determined in the investigation.' Bates, who has been a reserve since 2008, is the chief executive of Robert C Bates LLC, a Tulsa-based insurance company, who worked as an officer assigned to the Violent Crimes Task Force. He also spent time with the Tulsa Police Auxiliary. Speaking to local site News OK, Bates said: 'It was me. My attorney has advised me not to comment. As much as I would like to, I can’t.' According to Tulsa Police, Harris had met an undercover officer to sell him a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol and 300 rounds ammunition and ran when deputies tried to arrest him, then fought with another deputy when he was shot.

His convictions include escaping prison in 1990, robbery with a dangerous weapon in 1999, and making threatening phone calls. According to Tulsa Police, Harris' killer, Bates, is classified as an advanced deputy. Reserves are 'basic', 'intermediate', or 'advanced'. The qualify for 'advanced', officers are required to have a minimum of 320 hours of training and 25 hours of training a year. During the annual field training program, they are tested on how to use and identify lethal and non-lethal weapons.

The private Rochester data is understood to put Mr Reckless narrowly behind the Conservative candidate Kelly Tolhurst, who he defeated in November’s by-election. When Mr Reckless stood for the Tories at the 2010 Election he had a majority of just under 10,000 votes.

Officials ordered 250,000 birds to be slaughtered in Telangana after cases of the H5N1 virus were identified, which can be deadly in humans. The virus caused the deaths of nearly 400 people and hundreds of millions of poultry after it spread from Asia into Europe and Africa in 2005-2006. Culled: About 250,000 birds infected with the H5N1 virus are slaughtered in Telangana, India . Since then, India has regularly reported cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild and domestic birds. Veterinary staff from the local government's animal husbandry department carried out the cull - which included destroying hundreds of thousands of infected eggs - at Thorrur village in the Ranga Reddy district. Birds present in poultry farms were slaughtered while the eggs, including those stored in warehouses, were dumped in a pit. Destroyed: Thousands of infected eggs were dumped in a pit and buried following an outbreak of bird flu . Clean up: Authorities ordered the destruction of birds and eggs at farms across Telangana in India following the latest bird flu outbreak . Bird feed stock was burned and the sites were all thoroughly disinfected in a bid to stop the virus from spreading. India has culled 6.4 million birds due to bird flu since 2006. Experts point out that cross-infection to humans is still relatively rare and usually occurs where people have been in close contact with infected birds. But fears remain the aviation flu could combine with a human strain to produce a mutation that is more dangerous and difficult to control. In February, three people were tested for bird flu and 10,000 chickens slaughtered in Britain's first outbreak of the H7N7 strain in seven years. There have been several outbreaks of the H7N7 flu in China and 18 months ago it was found in Italy. During the Italian outbreak in August 2013, three poultry workers became infected with the virus, developing conjunctivitis.

Speaking to Ceredigion Council, DC Jones stressed that issues surrounding terrorism were not confined to large cities. Incidents of Islamic extremist activity in Wales can be traced back to 1998, when it is claimed hate preacher Abu Hamza sent a group of 10 extremists to train in the Brecon Beacons, in Powys. The area is one of several locations used by the British military for training. Its rugged terrain helps prepare soldiers, including elite forces personnel like the SAS, physically and mentally for warfare.

Victoria Ayling, who is running for the key election seat of Great Grimsby, made the comments after being confronted by her local party over her non-attendance at Ukip meetings. After saying it was because she had spent ‘five months nursing her son back to health after being blown up in Afghanistan’, Lieutenant Colonel Ron Shepherd, the leader of Ukip’s North East Lincolnshire group, launched an investigation. Scroll down for video . Row: UKIP politician Victoria Ayling, with party leader Nigel Farage, who is being questioned over claims about son . Astonishingly, he has raised questions about whether she has misrepresented her son’s situation. Mrs Ayling denies that is the case. It is the latest controversy to hit the 55-year-old, who in 2013 was caught on camera calling for all immigrants to be repatriated, saying: ‘I just want to send the lot back.’ She claimed her remarks had been taken ‘out of context’.

The seat is high on Ukip leader Nigel Farage’s hitlist. Controversy: Victoria Ayling on front page of Mail on Sunday .

I have spoken with the Adjutant of 1 RA who cannot release details to me. Anthony’s grandmother Brenda has stated he’s not been blown up.’ Shortly afterwards, Mrs Ayling was confronted by local Ukip councillor Matt Stinson about whether her son had been injured. The incident took place at a meeting attended by David Soutter, whose job is to vet Ukip candidates. Mrs Ayling fought back, saying: ‘It is a private matter and nothing to do with you, Matt.

Porto take a two-goal advantage to Munich next Tuesday for the return leg of the last-eight clash after punishing a sloppy Bayern with two early goals from Ricardo Quaresma and a second-half effort from Jackson Martinez. Guardiola said: 'We have players who were out a long time with injuries ... their legs don't last very long. It's a tough result to take into the second leg, but we'll give it a go.' Pep Guardiola says his side suffered with the injuries they are currently contending with in the squad . Porto manager Julen Lopetegui said his side can now dream of reaching the semi-finals, but they will need to be 'perfect' in the second leg. 'Now we have produced a situation for ourselves where we can dream, knowing that we will need to give everything we have got to get through,' Lopetegui, a former Barcelona team mate of Guardiola, told reporters. 'We will need to produce a perfect performance in Germany next week to progress.' Julen Lopetegui says reaching the Champions League semi-final would be a dream come true . Ricardo Quaresma (7) gave Porto an early lead from the spot but Manuel Neuer was lucky to be on the pitch . Lopetegui said the return from injury of goalscorer Martinez, who had been out since early March with a hamstring problem, was one of the reasons for Wednesday's victory. 'With him back in the attack, we were able to press Bayern with some force and give them real problems,' he said. Martinez, who capitalised on an error by Jerome Boateng in the 65th minute to round Bayern keeper Manuel Neuer for Porto's third goal after Thiago Alcantara had reduced the arrears, said he was not yet 100 percent fit. The striker was a constant menace for Bayern's defenders and his tenacious harrying was rewarded after three minutes when he robbed Xabi Alonso before being brought down by Neuer for a penalty that Quaresma converted. Jackson Martinez (right) rounds Neuer to slot home Porto's third goal and put them in control . Martinez troubled Bayern throughout and tackled Xabi Alonso (right) in the build up to the penalty . It was a similar story for Porto's second goal when Quaresma picked the pocket of Dante before beating Neuer with a clever finish on 10 minutes. 'It was fundamental that we tried our best to impose ourselves on Bayern and not give them a chance to settle,' Martinez said. Quaresma also sought to heap praise on Porto's team ethic, saying hard work had proved the difference between the two teams. 'There are no stars here. We all work hard for our results,' the forward said. 'The win is more important to us than the display. We have all worked extremely hard to get this win to give ourselves something to defend in the second leg.'

The mother of a girl who was murdered 40 years ago finally asked to see the crime scene photos of her daughter's body and now says she wants revenge. Virginia Trimble Ritter's daughter, Marcia, was raped and choked to death by Jerome Sydney Barrett in 1975 . Marcia's body was found 33 days after she disappeared and Ritter's then-husband advised her against seeing the body and the crime scene photos . Charlie, who died in 1989, wanted their last memory to be of her running in and out of the house, 'the real Marcia.' But Ritter told The Tennessean, last year it was a decision she now regrets. 'I have never seen a close-up photo and I want to. I'm going to.' She had declined to see the photos for several decades, and not even after Barrett was convicted 33 years later. But last year she asked Mickey Miller, Metro police lead investigator who worked on the case if she could see them. She says he tried to convince her not to see them, but she persisted and she viewed them on his laptop. Jerome Sidney Barrett, 68, was found guilty of second-degree murder six years ago and a Davidson County Criminal Court jury imposed a sentence of 44 years (pictured in 2009) 'Her mouth was black,' Ritter said. 'And her face, her head was swollen. It didn't look like Marcia. But to see her other parts of her body looked like Marcia. She said her daughter had vomit across her, her hair was pulled out in parts and there was blood on her scalp. Ritter said she shouted, 'If I had a gun I'd kill him!' Marcia's body was found 150 yards from her home amid the clutter of a rarely used, windowless garage, under a shower curtain and a child's wading pool. She had been strangled and sexually assaulted, and her cookie money was missing. Cookies were scattered around the clothed body. A neck bone was fractured. The case was Nashville's most notorious unsolved murder for 33 years. In 1979 police charged a Trimble neighbor with the slaying, but prosecutors dropped the charges about a year later because of lack of evidence. He was 15 at the time of the crime. Barrett, 68, was living in Memphis when he was arrested in 2006. He was brought in after police matched the DNA on the murdered child's clothing to that of his. The match happened after he was arrested for the 1975 murder of Vanderbilt University student Sarah Vannatta Des Prez. Barrett had been in prison on sex charges between 1974 and 2002 except for about a year when Marcia disappeared. In 2009 he was found guilty of second-degree murder of Marcia and a Davidson County Criminal Court jury imposed a sentence of 44 years.", "highlights": "Virginia Trimble Ritter's daughter, Marcia, was raped and choked to death by Jerome Sydney Barrett in 1975 .\nThe case was Nashville's most notorious unsolved murder for 33 years .\nRitter, who did not see her daughter's body at the time, recently asked to see the photos investigators took at the scene .\nAfter seeing the photos, Ritter said she shouted, 'If I had a gun I'd kill him!'", "source": "cnn_dailymail/3.0.0:test"}

AP McCoy will race at Sandown on Saturday for the last time before he retires following a successful career . McCoy has two rides at Sandown on Saturday before he retires from professional racing for good . 'It is a bit like watching Lionel Messi on a horse,' said Thornton. 'He had so much time but he has a technique you wouldn't teach to anybody. 'It might sound like madness when you are talking about a 20-time champion but it is unique. He keeps the bit high up in the horse's mouth though the general rule is to drop your hands on the back of your mount's neck. But AP loves to be in 100 per cent control. Whatever his mount does, it is his decision. 'He judges pace so well. He leaves his runs later now and he adapted his style since he started riding for Jonjo O'Neill.

He would probably even admit he got some horses beaten around Cheltenham in the early days that would not get beaten now. 'He is very aware of what is going on around him. If you look at this year's Grand National, and when he won it in 2010 on Don't Push It, he had so much room. He finds room in a race and uses it. 'You also never know how much he has left in the tank. You very rarely see him sitting still. It is a bit like a coiled spring.' McCoy (left) and wife Chanelle will host a party at home on Sunday for family and friends . Thornton, who needs fewer than 20 winners to reach 1,000 in his career, says age has mellowed McCoy, who is an unassuming figure among his colleagues. Former jockey Luke Harvey, now a TV presenter for At The Races, agrees. 'He has never been the big 'I am'. 'I used to run The Blowing Stone pub in Lambourn and he would come along even though he doesn't drink. 'He would stand in and play for the pool team and what p***ed you off was that he was good at that as well. McCoy and Mr Mole will have six rivals in the Grade One Celebration Chase at Sandown on Saturday . 'Before he was married, his home was like a doss house, full of jockeys who got back late from racing and could not be bothered to go home. 'Seamus Durack (now a Lambourn trainer) bought a house but liked living at AP's so much he rented it out and stayed at AP's.'

Campbell has joined forces with Homeland actor David Harewood, musician Tinie Tempah and Paralympic medallist//television presenter Ade Adepitan. The campaign, run by Operation Black Vote, features the stars in striking photographs ahead of the voting registration deadline on April 20. Sol Campbell is part of a new campaign to encourage minorities to register to vote for the General Election . Ex-England star Campbell retired from football in 2012 and is considering a career in politics . Campbell, 40, last month ruled out standing for the Conservatives in Kensington after Sir Malcolm Rifkind announced he would be standing down. At the time he said his 'ambitions lie elsewhere in the political arena' which led to speculation he could run for London Mayor. Campbell posed for a photograph with his face coloured white alongside the caption, 'If you don't register to vote, you're taking the colour out of Britain.' And on launching the campaign, Harewood said: 'What it brilliantly illustrates is that if you don't register to vote, you are quite literally taking all the vibrancy we have in our community off the table . 'If you don't register to vote, politicians don't really care about you, politicians aren't really caring about what you have to say, what you have to do, anything. Campbell won 73 caps for his country, scoring one goal over the space of nine years . 'The only way they talk to you is if you register to vote. That is when you become an important part of the electorate.' Operation Black Vote also launched a 2015 general election manifesto with the aim of 'reclaiming democracy, empowering citizens and fighting race equalities'. It says that in the past black and minority ethnic (BME) groups presented a broad range of 'key policy demands' to all parties, but adds: 'Our experience shows that whilst all parties express interest in our proposals during elections, this interest soon evaporates once in power.' Instead OBV has created a list of manifesto points of its own, including automatic voter registration linked to the National Insurance system, the introduction of e-voting and proportional representation, voting from the age of 16, state funding of parties and a 'minister for race equality' in the Cabinet.

{"id": "10818", "article": "Google paid its billionaire Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt nearly $109 million last year while the company's stock slumped. Most of the compensation consisted of stock valued at $100 million. It was the largest stock package that Schmidt has received since 2011 when Google Inc. awarded him a bundle valued at $94 million at the time he relinquished the CEO's job to company co-founder Larry Page. Documents filed with regulators Thursday also disclosed that Page and the company's other founder, Sergey Brin, limited their 2014 pay to $1 each, as has been their practice for years. Payday: Google paid its billionaire Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt nearly $109 million last year while the company's stock slumped, it's been revealed . Schmidt also pocketed a $1.25 million salary, a $6 million bonus and perks valued at nearly $1 million. His total pay last year soared by more than five-fold from 2013 when his Google compensation was valued at $19.3 million. The hefty raise came in a year that saw Google's stock drop by 5 percent amid investor concerns about the company's big spending on far-flung projects. Analysts have also questioned whether Google will be able to maintain its dominance in Internet search as more people rely on smartphones instead of personal computers to access digital content. The downturn in Google's stock contrasted with an 11 percent gain in the Standard & Poor's 500 index last year. Schmidt, 59, already is among the world's richest people with an estimated fortune of $9 billion, according to Forbes. Most of his wealth has been built on the Google stock that he began accumulating when he became the Mountain View, California, company's CEO in 2001. The Associated Press calculates executive compensation by including salary, bonuses, perks, above-market interest that the company pays on deferred compensation, and the estimated value of stock and stock options awarded during the year. It does not include changes in the present value of pension benefits, so the AP total can differ slightly from the total reported by company.

Kenyan authorities have not released a list of the victims. The posts provided heart-wrenching details on the victims, including one about an elderly man whose dreams died with his son. He had reportedly taken a loan to educate him at the university, where he was killed by Al-Shabaab terrorists. The attack in Kenya killed 142 students, three security officers and two university security personnel, and was the nation's deadliest since the bombing of the U.S. Embassy in 1998. Kenyan churches mourned the dead during Easter services Sunday as armed guards protected the congregations. In emotional services nationwide, churchgoers wept as they paid tribute to the victims of the massacre.

{"id": "1997", "article": "Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini believes the club may need to splash out again this summer to keep pace with their rivals. With hopes of retaining the Barclays Premier League crown looking increasingly forlorn, City have again failed to build on a title success. They were hampered last summer, however, with their punishment for breaching the Financial Fair Play regulations of European governing body UEFA including a £49million net spending cap. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini insists his side must splash the cash in the summer . Pellegrini has said Manchester City must sign a 'crack' player such as striker Sergio Aguero . Man City are currently fourth in the Premier League . A return to the heavy spending of the era immediately after Sheikh Mansour's 2008 takeover is clearly not an option, for fear of invoking even tougher sanctions, but Pellegrini has warned they cannot stay idle. Pellegrini recently spoke of a need to sign a 'crack' player - in other words a superstar of the calibre of striker Sergio Aguero - and has now suggested this summer is the time to do it. The Chilean, whose side have slipped to fourth place ahead of Monday's trip to Crystal Palace, said: 'Well, it is just the way of thinking, that big teams need to sign a big player. It is very difficult to do it every year - but every two years you must do it. 'I'm not just talking about Manchester City. You see Real Madrid, Manchester United, Chelsea, Barcelona and Bayern Munich - all the big clubs - they all do it. It is important to have big names.' Given the general disappointments of last summer's principle signings - Fernando, Bacary Sagna and Eliaquim Mangala - Pellegrini's words could be perceived as a plea for more cash. But when pushed further, Pellegrini, perhaps not surprisingly given that his own position could be uncertain, would not say whether a spending spree might be sanctioned. Pellegrini still believes his Manchester City side are capable of retaining the Premier Legaue title . He said: 'I don't want to talk about (plans) for next season because we have to finish this season. It is very important the way we finish this season before we analyse all the players. So it is not the right moment to talk about it.' Pellegrini's immediate concern is his side's league position. Results elsewhere have seen City drop two places over the weekend and, although Pellegrini has not given up on the title, he clearly cannot even take the runners-up spot for granted. He said: 'Well we are not thinking about just one team. I think it is important for our team to finish at the top of the table but if we can't win the Premier League then we must try to be second. 'But it is important to play from now until the end of the season in a way that shows you are an important team and are prepared to fight until the last game to try and retain the title.'", "highlights": "Manuel Pellegrini believes Man City need to sign a world class superstar .\nThe Chilean insists it is important to splash the cash every other season .\nCity brought in Eliaquim Mangala, Fernando and Bacary Sagna in summer .\nManchester City face Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park on Monday night .", "source": "cnn_dailymail/3.0.0:test"}

Antonio Valente, from Dallas, Texas, first learned of the ruse when he received a message from Marianne Heinrich, who lives in Vienna, two weeks ago, he told NBC DFW. She told him that someone using the name 'Johnson Michael Lynn' had created a fake Facebook profile using photos of him and his daughter before befriending Heinrich online. Scroll down for video . Shock: Antonio Valente, from Dallas, Texas, learned that his Facebook photos were being used on a fake account - and ultimately scammed an Austrian woman out of $4,000 . After a few weeks of friendly conversations with Heinrich, the man said he wanted to marry her and move to Austria to be with her and his daughter, she told Valente. When he said he needed money to pay taxes in England, Heinrich wired him $4,000. She soon realized she had been conned and used an image from the profile to search Google photos and discovered they had been stolen from Valente. Among the photographs shared by 'Johnson Michael Lynn' was also a photoshopped image showing Valente's face oddly placed on another person's body in hospital. Fake: The profile used his pictures but the name 'Johnson Michael Lynn' and claimed he was from Ohio . Scam: The profile showed photos of Valente's head pasted onto another person's body in hospital, left, and images of his seven-year-old daughter, right.

He wanted to report the problem to Facebook to get the fake profile removed but, because the scammer had blocked him on the website, it did not allow Valente to file a complaint. 'If you're blocked, it's circular,' Valente said. 'You can't do anything.' After being contacted by NBC, Facebook removed the profile.

Firing guns in the air is a traditional way of celebrating special occasions in some parts of Saudi Arabia and despite government efforts to stop it, the dangerous practice lingers on. Shotgun wedding: The groom's brother was caught on camera as he lost control of a Kalashnikov while firing a celebratory round into the air . Banging start: As the man starts shooting, he loses control of the rifle and fires at the wall by mistake, sending bullets spraying across the street over the wedding guest . The incident was caught on camera, and the short clip shows the wedding party making its way towards the wedding hall when suddenly the brother of the groom starts shooting in the air.

The 23-year-old, who impressed for Northern Ireland in the week, scored two quite stunning goals as Brentford demolished Fulham 4-1 on Good Friday. They go into Monday's game against Nottingham Forest eyeing more than just a play-off spot. It was three years ago when Dallas was spotted by Warburton playing part-time on a mud bath for Crusaders back home. Stuart Dallas celebrates the second of his two excellent goals against Fulham on good Friday . Dallas has been a revelation this season as he helps Brentford push towards the Premier League . There were those who felt he wasn’t cut out for League One last season, but a three-month loan at Northampton has turned the winger into an integral figure as Brentford hunt Premier League promotion. ‘When I signed Stuart he was training once a week. He’s getting better and better - there’s more to come,’ Warburton said, before vouching for the maligned loan system. ‘Look at Alex Pritchard, on loan from Tottenham. Get the loan right, where all three parties benefit. The 23-year-old starred for Northern Ireland last week, and his manager says it is down to his loan spell . Dallas spent three months at Northampton and has returned to prove himself back at Brentford . ‘Toumani Diagouraga went to Portsmouth [this season], played seven games and was made captain, came back and hasn’t looked back. Likewise with Stuart.

Sajid Javid declared some values prevalent in certain Asian communities were 'totally unacceptable in British society' Mr Javid told the Daily Telegraph a 'misplaced sense of political correctness' prevented police and social workers from properly investigating claims of abuse. Mr Javid said: 'Well, first of all the perpetrators were disproportionately Asian Muslim men, and I absolutely think there has been a misplaced sense of political correctness that prevented authorities, whether social workers or police, from properly investigating what was going on. 'If we are to learn proper lessons from this, we have to look at the cultural side of some communities in Britain and see why it is that in some communities there are men that have a view of women that is completely unacceptable in modern British society. Why do they have such a low value of women that they see them as commodities to be abused?' The Tory minister said the authorities had to 'get to the bottom of this' and emphasised that 'we have to look at the cultural aspects of it'. The Tory minister's comments come after inquiries into the sexual abuse of vulnerable girls targeted by Asian men in Rochdale, Rotherham and Oxford found that the authorities had failed to protect them . He urged Asian communities to look into 'what might be going on that we don't know about'. Mr Javid said: 'We can no longer be held back in any sense by political correctness. 'I know plenty of people, British Muslims, men and women, who would 100 per cent agree with that, not only out of a sense of shame but also because of the fear of what else might be going on. Some of the values that certain people in some communities have, in their attitudes to women or on the question of freedom of expression, are just totally unacceptable in British society. 'We do no one any favours when we don't investigate or talk about them.' Mr Javid revealed in a speech to the Union of Jewish Students in 2014 that he had experienced racism at school. He said he was called a 'Paki' by a classmate. He said: 'I did what any cool, calm future Cabinet minister would do. I hit him. And then he hit me, and I hit him back and things sort of went downhill from there.' Mr Javid, whose background is remarkably different to many of his colleagues, has been tipped as a future Tory leader. His parents came to Britain from Pakistan in 1961.

A phone thief took a selfie with a handset before stealing a model he preferred - only to be caught when police identified him from the photo. Ivan Balashov was browsing through smartphones in a shop in Novokuznetsk, southern Russia when he took a picture of himself wearing a bobble hat and a fake Reebok top. But after deciding the camera on the mobile was not good enough, the 22-year-old grabbed another handset and headed for the exit where he was stopped by shop security. A shop spokesman said: 'When he was asked where he was going he told the security guard that he wanted to buy the phone - and was going to his car to get his wallet. 'For some reason the guard let him go outside the shop with the phone at which point the man ran off.' But when police arrived they quickly discovered Balashov’s selfie. A police spokesman said: 'The man is well-known to the police so when the shop assistant told officers he had been taking photos with another phone they immediately recognised him and were able to go straight to the man’s house. 'When they arrived he denied being anywhere near the shop so in a way condemned himself as we were able to prove he had been there just 30 minutes earlier.' On his way home he had sold the stolen phone in a pawn shop for the equivalent of £120. Appearing in court, Balashov was found guilty and given a three month suspended sentence. Police found Balashov's selfie on a phone in the store and immiediately recognised him.
